# Angular Material Checkbox Demo

For my Prime Digital Academy solo project I wanted to implement checkboxes.  I also wanted to use Angular Material and had 
not used it before.  This repo was created as a spike to demo Angular Material checkboxes.  Based on the demo code from the 
Angular Material website, I was able to implement checkboxes on a basic html page.  Part of the spike involved figuring out what 
needed to be sourced in and in what order.
